# Solr's silly NixOS configuration

> [!CAUTION]

This is my personal NixOS and Home Manager configuration using [flakes](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-flake.html). Feel free to use it as is or as a reference. While writing this configuration I did my best to understand how and why it functions and leave explanatory comments. A list of configurations made by other people that I learned from is presented [below](#References).

## TODO

- [ ] Figure out how Cachix for Hyprland works or remove it
- [ ] ~~Declarative flatpak configuration (focusing on user applications)~~
- [ ] Use adw-gtk3 for GTK3 apps
- [ ] Move libvirtd user group assignment into virt.nix
- [ ] Possibly remove Stylix from specialArgs and use inputs
- [ ] Nvim configuration
- [ ] Presentable Hyprland configuration
- [ ] Leave only necessary imports in derivations
- [ ] Add monitor configuration
- [ ] Separate system and user configurations
- [ ] ~~Custom SDDM theme in Hyprland~~
- [ ] ~~Write a GNOME config (for completeness' sake)~~
- [ ] ~~Set stylix.targets.gnome.enable in GNOME config~~
- [x] TOML configuration for basic system profile features (like encryption, vpn)
- [x] TOML configuration for basic user profile features
- [x] Uniform system styling using [Stylix](https://github.com/danth/stylix)
- [x] Minimal usable configuration for KDE Plasma

## Structure
